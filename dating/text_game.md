# texting

- Use minimum texting. Detailed stories and information are shared in dates.
- Use emoji as softener. Don't apologize(e.g. say "just kidding") for teasing, 
which conveys that you feel bad about what you said. 
    
  Use emoji as softener instead, or haha encourage her to laugh with you.
  
  In contrast, you could say "just kidding" after a compliment.
  
# reverse the frame

- Ask her questions that she might ask you or challenge you. 
  
# reward

Every reward is conditional. Do not give away yourself without her earning it. When you try to ask her out,
say "maybe" for any propose. For example:

> If We Both Free
>
> Maybe If We Are Both Free
>
> Maybe One Day We Get A Juice

# ask her questions in a playful way

ask in a third person point of view, as if you are gossiping together about another person
> tell me about yourself
> v.s
> tell me about \<her name\>

ask situational question, that comes with a interesting story/setting.

# qualification

When you try to make her to qualify herself, and she refuses. She probably knows the game.
For example
> - Are you boring? :)
> - Yes I'm boring
> - Really? 

Say "really?" as if you are genuinely asking the question and take her answer seriously.
