# conversation structure

## structure

opener ---> transition ---> general conversation ---> social investment
---> romantic investment

## opener

- Direct : state your intent
- Indirect: ask a question that's not related to her, e.g. ask for direction
- Friendly: ask a question related to her, e.g. comment on her outfit 

Direct is bad because:
 - you give her power
 - she is more alarmed
 - she might reject you right away
 - you will still need to build comfort. Going direct does not accomplish anything
 
Only go direct she's given you clear sign of interest or in a good mood.

Tester: excuse me, i'm trying to figure this out....
1. She's busy or non-reactive: use indirect opener like asking for direction.
Using friendly opener here would make you seem try hard.
2. Friendly and receptive: use friendly opener like "i like your shirt..." 
"what's your opinion...".

## transition

transition phrases:
- oh that reminds me
- oh by the way
- while you were talking I noticed...
- oh you know what...
- oh yea check this out

## general conversation

Get to know you small talks like "where are you from" "have you seen this show"

## social investment

Get her to invest. She should start to open up to you and share personal stories.

Use qualification level 1 and 2.

## romantic investment

progressive frames:
- touchy/playful/flirty/quirky/sexual

1. light friendly sarcastic exaggerated liking
> I'm totally falling in love with you
> I love that about you, you get a hug for that
2. observations about her that is sexy

> you have a sexy/cute (butt, walk, gait, vibe...)

3. comments of sexual actions you want to do with them(when you are already holding hands)
> Just so you know I'm trying to get in your pants
>
> I'm looking at you and I just got lost looking at your lips just thinking about how it would
> feel like to make out with you right now

4. sexual role play(not a must)(on the way home)
> I can totally tell when we have sex it's gonna be so on
>
> Hey want to see a magic trick? Hold on... Wow you just made it levitate, it's amazing you're genious
>how did you do it?
>
>getaway vacation
