5. practice and refine

# types of stories

   demonstrated in the story

   Allow her to relive the moments with you.

# cold reads
- i see you're the type of person...
- you look like the kind of girl...
- i notice you...
- there's something about you that says...

Focus on positive impression, to get the girl to project positive image about herself.

Advanced cold reads use a compliment to embed a challenge to the girl's self-conception.
For example, "you seem really self-assured, but I can tell there are times when you struggle
with doubt"
                                                                                                                                                                                                      
# role play

you can be much bolder with sexual innuendo because of plausible deniability.

# avoid interview mode

comment on her answer before ask another question

# Anti-slut Syndrome

- be non-judgemental
- plausible deniability
- discretion. No woman wants to risk her reputation by having a guy tell people that they had sex.
Convey that you are discrete about these type of matters.

# qualification ladder

Get her to impress you. If she tells you a story without you asking her, it's not qualification.
It has to be framed as she trying to impress you.

1. yes no question about herself.(social)
    > I love adventurous people. Would you consider that about yourselves?
2. question that requires a few sentences of explaining.(social)
    > You say you are adventurous. What's one of the most adventurous thing you've done?
3. question that requires high-investment answers.(social & romantic)
This is where it becomes obvious that you are qualifying her
    > So what do you have going for you besides looks? 
    > Tell me about a quality of yourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                
4. Romantic qualifier while holding hands. (romantic & sexual) If she successfully qualifies, 
then focus on going for a kiss if you haven't done so already.
    > I think you're growing on me. Give me one reason why you think it's worth dating you.

2-3 qualifiers for level 1,2, only need one qualifier for level 3, 4.

Make sure she's in the right state of mind when she qualifies. If she's drunk or just doing it
for fun, it does not count.
