1. To import file from another directory, you need to add the directory to the system path.

    ```
    import sys
    sys.path.append("/path/to/dir")
    ```

 because by default, the interpreter won't import anything with the same name that already exists. 

    Use reload.

    ```
    import importlib
    importlib.reload(test_rich)
    ```

3. import will run everything in the file unless the code chunk is under `if __name__=='main':`
